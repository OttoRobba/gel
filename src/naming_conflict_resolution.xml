      love.clear (love.event vs love.graphics, they do different things. Can be resolved by having events use underscore)
      love.draw (love.draw vs love.graphics.draw, they do different things. Can be resolved by having love.draw use underscore)
		love.getDimensions (Window vs Graphics, Seems to be the same thing, Window seems to be the right one to use)
      love.getHeight (Window vs Graphics, Seems to be the same thing, Window seems to be the right one to use)
      love.getPosition (Audio vs Mouse. Important for both. Audio with underscore doesn't seem ideal but might be the lesser of two evils)
      love.getWidth (Window vs Graphics, Seems to be the same thing, Window seems to be the right one to use)
      love.isDown   (mouse vs keyboard. No good solution here. Maybe leave the mouse/keyboard part as a variable?)
      love.isVisible  (window vs mouse, no clear solution here. Maybe make it so keyboard and mouse have different conventions?)
      love.load   (load.filesystem vs love.load Love.* already uses underscore, no problem here)
      love.push (love.event vs love.graphics, they do different things. Can be resolved by having events use underscore)
      love.quit (love.event vs love.quit, not sure how to fix. Perhaps dot instead of underscore?)
      love.setPosition (audio vs mouse, not sure how to resolve)
